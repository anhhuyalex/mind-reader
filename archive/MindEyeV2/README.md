In-progress

1. Download all of https://huggingface.co/datasets/pscotti/mindeyev2 and place them in a folder. You will need to specify the path to this folder as "data_path" variable.

2. Run setup.sh to install a new "fmri" conda environment.

3. Activate the conda environment with "conda activate fmri"

4. Run Train.ipynb or Train.py (they are the same code)
